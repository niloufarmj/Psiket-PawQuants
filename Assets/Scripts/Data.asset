  - Welcome to PawQuants! These two cats have been messing with the wrong yarn and
    gotten themselves entangled. To bring them back to normal, you will need to untangle
    them by recreating the patterns shown as islands on water. As they are entangled,
    both characters will move with the same inputs. Use the arrow keys to move.
  - There is a box here marked with an X. It is a quantum X gate. This will invert
    the controls of whoever walks over it. Luckily, here it looks like it will make
    this otherwise impossible pattern possible again.
  - You may have noticed the Current State at the top of the screen. This tells you
    the  current state of the entangled cats. This will be useful to understand when
    the  puzzles get more complex and you need to keep track of how each characer
    is  going to move. The state |00>+| 11> is the default state (bell state) where
    both characters act as expected. It  is made up of 2 parts, each looking like
    I xy> where x is the state of left  cat and y is the state of right cat. In the
    first set of numbers, a 0 means  the character is acting as normal, a 1 means
    the character's controls are inverted.  Later you will see there are other gates
    and states to consider too.
  -

  - Look, this box is labeled with a H. It is a quantum Hadamard gate. If a  character
    walks over this gate, it will modify the Current State for that character by 
    changing a 0 to a + and vice versa, and changing a 1 to a - and vice versa.  
    A character with a + state will have their controls rotated clockwise such that 
    up -> right -> down -> left -> up   A character with a - state will have their
    controls rotated the other way. See if you  can figure out how to solve this
    pattern using this new gate.

  - 'Be carful here, you may think that walking over an X gate while in the state
    + or -  would swap them, but this is not the case. In fact, an X gate does nothing
    if you''re  in the state + or -   You may have noticed that when you went over
    an X gate and then a H gate you  were in the state -, but if you went over a
    H gate and then an X gate you''d still be  in the X state. This is one thing
    to note about quantum gates, they are non  commuting , meaning the order you
    apply them can change the end results. '
  - 
  - Here is the final gate in this game, the Y gate. This will switch + into - and
    - into +  while doing nothing to the 0 and 1 states. You can think of it asan
    X gate for when  you're in the +/- basis.   Note that applying gates from right
    to left, XH is the same as HY. It's almost as if  moving the X gate across the
    Hadamard gate turns it into a Y gate.
