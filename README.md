# PawQuants - A Quantum Pixel Adventure

PawQuants is a captivating quantum pixel game that challenges your control and perception. In this game, Schr√∂dinger's cats have accidentally become entangled after meddling in the quantum laboratory. Your task is to guide these cats from their starting point to their destination, ensuring that they do not fall into the water, as cats are not known for their swimming abilities.

## Gameplay

The controls in PawQuants are straightforward. You can move the cats left, right, up, or down using the directional keys. The main challenge lies in determining the correct direction to move, as the cats' behavior is influenced by the quantum gates they encounter.

There are three types of quantum gates in the game:

1. **X Gate**: Reverses the direction of the cat's movement. For example, if you press the right key, the cat will move left.
2. **H (Hadamard) Gate**: Transforms the direction of the cat's movement in the quantum space by adding one. For instance, if you press the up key, the cat will move right.
3. **Y Gate**: Behaves similarly to the X gate, but its effect is nullified if the cat has already passed through an H gate. In this case, the Y gate will reverse the movement previously transformed by the H gate.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to control the movement of the cats.
2. Carefully navigate the cats through the quantum gates, taking into account their unique properties, to reach the destination.
3. Avoid letting the cats fall into the water, as they cannot swim.
